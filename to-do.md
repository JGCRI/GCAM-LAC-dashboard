## To Do List

### UI
* Add go button to sidebar controls?

### plotMap
* Detect what input controls have changed and only update the things that are affected.
* When a new combination scenario/query/map view is received, render all years and cache as images (for faster update on animations, etc.)
* Make legend wider/shorter.
* Additional controls for plot appearance
    ** Color scale selector
    ** Zero pin or not
* Non-conformable arrays error.  (Aggregate before differencing?)

### Data
* Check why Reference "Electricity Generation by Technology" appears to have negative values.
